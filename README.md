 Unit 5 Treehouse Interactive Photo Gallery

 This is the 5th project for Treehouse demonstrating an interactive photo gallery.
 The gallery is made primarily using CSS Grid and JavaScript. 
 A search function to filter specific images is one feature of JavaScript shown here. 
 JavaScript is also used when enlarging images and being able to cycle through them full screen. 
 The layout is created with CSS Grid.

 The project is supposed to roughly look like the mockups, with some minor personalization. 

 
 
 The code consists of SCSS(Sass), CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 
 Programs used: Visual Studio Code, Scout-App, and GitHub Desktop.
